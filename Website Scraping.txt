       Why Brock Purdy should be America's favourite son right now
    






    Brock Purdy should be America’s favourite son right now.
  
    Purdy has all the traits of the prototypical white-meat babyface that Americans have historically rooted for. He has been handed nothing his entire NFL career, was the last pick in the draft who got a roster spot because he balled out in the pre-season and started as QB3 on a roster with a top 3 draft pick ahead of him and a QB1 that had just been to a Superbowl. He’s a scrappy, undersized and humble small town kid from an afterthought state. In the larger than life and sometimes spiteful world of the NFL he is a Disney level protagonist.
  
    And yet it seems the entire NFL establishment wants him to fail. From talking heads in the media, to fans online and even ex NFL players like Cam Newton, it seems like despite the obvious against-the-odds narrative they could choose to get behind, the preferred narrative is that he’s overrated and will eventually fail.
  
    When did people become so jaded and cynical? Since entering the league in relief of Jimmy Garoppolo, Purdy has done nothing but play excellent ball and say and do everything right.
  
    Then there’s the players and the coaches. His fellow players from around the league consistently leap to his defense. He’s found allies far and wide with the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Baker Mayfield and Joe Burrow going on record in the media explaining how he’s not just a “game manager”, as if that’s some sort of slur in the first place. NFL coaches constantly sing his praises. The man whose job it is to stop him on Sunday, Kansas City Chiefs Defensive Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo called him “for real”."I don’t think people give him enough credit for the talent he has," Spagnuolo said. "And then, he’s got all those weapons around him. I’ve been thoroughly impressed with what I’ve watched on tape over the last eight days. I’ve watched about every game now, and I don’t see the guy making very many mistakes."
  
    Ex Carolina Panthers head coach Matt Rhule claimed to have pushed to get Purdy put up on the Panthers draft big board to no avail and Chiefs head coach Andy Reid can also be counted as a fan.
  
    “Listen, he’s a heck of a player,” Reid said of Purdy. “I remember specifically one of the Saturday afternoons watching him in college and I remember the head coach saying, ‘This guy has changed our program.’ Changing a program, you know, that’s … big. And that’s what he is. He’s doing that in the National Football League.”
  
    What is it that the players, coaches and 49ers fans can see that the rest of the fans and seemingly the media can’t?
  
    It’s certainly not the stats. The last pick in the 2022 NFL draft paints a pretty picture by the numbers. When you compare him to the earlier mentioned three QBs, his career passer rating, TD/INT ratio and completion percentage are all superior. He’s also shown himself to be the equal or better of the three of them running the ball. That’s a multi-time MVP and two number 1 draft picks. These are three of the best QBs in the league.
  
    Some say he’s good but not great, and that their issue isn’t that they dislike him or don’t think he’s good, but that they think he’s just not as good as we think*.* They point towards his coach Kyle Shanahan making things easier for him. His All-Pro left tackle and his OPOY running back taking pressure off of him. His cadre of receiving weapons. His tight-end who himself is on a hall of fame trajectory. They say this all as a way to emphasise that he’s just not as good as it seems. As though that's a drum that must be beaten. That we all have to understand that this scrappy underdog kid that does everything right including spending his downtime on his girlfriend's family farm while other players prefer the bright lights of Las Vegas, is not awesome.
  
    The only problem with that is that when you put on the tape you see that he is actually awesome. There's downfield throws outside the pocket or off the back foot with the pocket collapsing. You see clutch 3rd downs completed with his legs and his arm. You see on time throws hitting receivers in stride. The tape simply does not point at anything but him being great. Why do people always fail to recognise that he's done this with one of the least effective offensive lines in the league? Why do these people never caveat it by pointing out that his downfield throwing numbers lead the league? That his throwing numbers under pressure lead the league?

    So if it’s not the stats, and he actually does in fact move the needle himself, why is he so maligned?
  
    The honest answer is that it is probably envy. The 49ers hitting on a franchise QB with the last pick in the draft after trading 3 first round picks for a guy that didn’t pan out in Trey Lance is a minor miracle. They were a franchise that was already strong just trying to find a way to improve that one little bit more to get them from NFC Champion to Superbowl winner. They messed up in that attempt but seem to have succeeded anyway. For fans of teams around the league struggling to get over the hump or rooted at the bottom that would be a bitter pill to swallow. Maybe that’s the real underlying sentiment behind it and Brock is a victim of that. If that is the case then the hope would be that at some point people can actually stop and recognise that what they are witnessing is a magnificent underdog story. That if Brock Purdy can win the Superbowl it’s going to be one of the greatest NFL stories of all time. It might even be the greatest.
  
    Maybe Brock will regress to the mean at some point. It seems unlikely that he can sustain his passer rating at the very least. But as each passing game goes by it seems less and less likely that what we’re witnessing is a flash in the pan. He just keeps moving forward, keeps making throws on time. Keeps making his weapons look great.
  
    On Sunday in just his second season, and his first full one, Mr. Irrelevant finds himself squaring off with the newest NFL dynasty. Led by the aforementioned new GOAT candidate Patrick Mahomes and a newly acquired army of “Swifties” courtesy of the emergent “love story” between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, once again Purdy finds himself the underdog with neutral fans and the media. And once again the numbers seem to be pointing at him getting the job done, with Vegas installing the 49ers as mild favourites to win their 6th Lombardi Trophy.
  
    If this small town kid from Arizona does the unthinkable and he can win a Superbowl in his first full season will the media and the fans around the league wake up from their envy induced stupor? Frankly it doesn't matter. Because at no point throughout all of this as Brock even for a single minute doubted himself, or indicated that the doubt gets to him. If anything it seems to fuel him. So keep doubting Brock Purdy for the rest of his career and fueling his tank. As a 49ers fan I thank you for your service.

    How did you pick your allegiance to your team and does your college rivalry play into that?
  
    For example
  
    Oklahoma fans, do you root for Texas based teams? Or do you root for other teams out of spite like the Chiefs?
  
    Bama fans, do you root for the Falcons, Titans?
  
    What about Oregon fans and the Seahawks
  
    Nebraska you hate Colorado but do you root for the Broncos?
  
    Or do you guys just pick a random team and root for them?

        The NFL today is almost like a different game compared to the way it was played back in the day. The players  were often bloody and muddy, the quarterbacks weren’t treated like fragile primadonnas, and the logos and lore were legendary. If you are nostalgic for the Gridiron greatness of the past, this sub is for you.

    You remind me very much of the 2004 Pistons. Obviously Jalen is better than anyone on the 2004 Pistons, but it is the team first hard nose no nonsense structure, and dynamics that are very similar to the 04 Pistons. This isn't a team full of flashy superstars, but players that are stars in their positions. I think you might be the first team to win an NBA championship, without a generational superstar, since the 2004 Pistons. This will be very good for the league because it will end the era of the Superteam that started with the Lebron Big 3 Heat and Big 3 Celtics. You have great team offense, and are less than 4 points per 100 possessions behind the Timberwolves for best defensive rating in the NBA. The trades are a game changer for you. You are now a legitimate championship contender, and all of the books have you tied for 5th with the Suns for best odds to win the championship.

       NBA 2/9
    






    6 gamer.  Hot Dog
  
    Atl/Philly
  
    This new look Philly squad is bad man.  Like really bad.  Springer and Pat Bev were like the only dudes playing defense too.  Love the Hawks -2.5 today. Batum, Roco, Embiid, Buddy, Melton, Payne all OUT today.   Maxey, Tobias, Oubre are the new Big 3 here, and now Maxey is Questionable... BBall Paul is in play, and you can value hunt with KJ Martin, Terquavion Smith, and Ricky Council.  Yikes.  For the Hawks, No Capela tonight, and maybe no Hunter/Murray.  Okungwu/Jalen Johnson look good.  So do Bogi and Bey if the other guys sit.
  
    Celtics/Wizards
  
    Another yikes.  Wiz don't have a big man.  Eugene Omouriyi is looking like he'll get the run.  Rest of the Wiz will get minutes, so theyre usable.  But dudes like Coulibaly and Poole are unplayable.  Would stick to Tyus, Kuz, Kispert, Avdijaj if you're considering it.  Ugly.  Tatum was present at shoot around, but may get the rest vs this God awful Wiz squad.   Hoping he sits so we can really commit to JB and Porzingis.
  
    Rockets/Raptors
  
    Let's goo!  High and tight.  No Freddy Van Van again for the Rockets.  Lemme get an Amen!  Load up on the Rockets.  Not a bad play in sight.  Except Jock Landale.  Raptors get a little weird with their roto.  IQ, Barrett the safest.  Poeltl a foul trouble risk imo tonight vs Sengun, but the price is solid.  Scottie Barnes seems like he's still finding his groove with these new guys.  Will be low owned, but I'm hoping for just one more lil price drop before I smash again.
  
    Hornets/Bucks
  
    No travel to worry about tonight for ol Doc.  Lillard and Middleton are questionable, and ducked the Wolves last night.  This team needs a win bad.   Good spot for anyone that suits up for the Bucks.  Charlotte's even thinner after sending out PJ Washington.  Bridges and Miller.  Those are the only guys you can have confidence in.
  
    Nuggies/Kings
  
    Ah yes, the most bi polar team in the league, coming off a double digit home loss to the Pistons is a 2.5 pt favorite to the Champs.  KCP sat last night, might go tonight, might not.  That's the only thing of note on the injury report.  The prices for these guys potential look great.  I would expect a great game here.  Fantastic matchup of stud duos with Jokic/Murray and Fox/Domas.  Kings have the worst 3pt defense in the league.  MPJ should feast.  This is a great tournament game.  Won't be chalky anywhere, high risk, really high reward with these mid range guys, the low 8k guards, and 2 of the best all around big men in the league.
  
    Pels/Lakers
  
    Zion, Joval, Dlo and Max Christie are questionable.  Larry Nance and Brandon Ingram revenge spot?  Sign me the fuck up.  AD is too cheap.  Bron is Bron.  If the Laker guys sit, they'll have to play Rui and Prince a bunch.  Reaves is solid-ish.  Herb Jones price looks solid too.  Love getting to these late games.

    I personally have my eyes on Tidjaun Salaun , a 6’10 lengthy wing who has great physical tools to become a an elite defender and a silky jumpshot .

       We Used to Be the Best Fans in the NBA—and We Can Be Again
    






    We used to be the best and most loyal fans in the NBA. And we used to take pride in it. I started following the Kings in 1994. Occasional highs since then and also way too many very low lows. But I never stopped loving my team. I sure as hell never booed.
  
    I am deeply grateful to Mike Brown and this team for bringing the joy back to watching the season. We always have a chance to win, and each game actually matters. My whole family gathers together again to watch games.
  
    I get it guys. My heart has been broken time and again for 30 years. But the people booing THIS team and this coach, a team and coach who dug us out of hell in just a single season … it is unconscionable. We aren’t Lakers fans. We aren’t GS fans. We are Kings fans. Let’s act like it.

       Day removed: Vaslije Micic wasn't NBA-ready and the Gordon trade was exactly what was needed.
    






    In the vortex of yesterday's news it felt like a gut blow that we were losing him as he was a former MVP. Well, woke up thinking about it and I started thinking....am I ONLY upset because we lost a former Euro MVP???
  


    Micic has never started in his half-season with the Thunder
  


    Averaged 12 mins/gm. If we're using Roto's site, he was at the bottom of the rotation with Dieng. https://www.rotowire.com/basketball/rotations.php



    His sample size of stats - which again, is small due to his limited PT, is not that impressive. If you were to extrapolate you're looking at someone who may get you about 5-6 assists a game and maybe 10 points max?
  


    We all got eyes and we all saw a man who spent more time passing than shooting. That's COOL, BUT with Gordon you got someone who can pass AND shoot. Far from his glory years but has ready-made playoff experience.
  
    Biggest plus-side: If Gordon got hurt it's a loss, but not a big loss as the people who were traded for him were....outside of the rotation or in the case of Micic, barely hanging onto it.
  
    What I'm typing is the front office made the best trade they could in exchanging a person who wasn't ready for prime time  on a team who unexpectedly found themselves as the #1 seed for a player who when healthy can easily put 20/5/5 on the board.

       Does the NBA fix the draft lottery or is that tin foil hat craziness (year by year analysis)?
    






    The silly chatter that the NFL is rigging games to have the Chiefs and Taylor Swift in the Super Bowl reminded me of the Frozen Envelope theory.  That conspiracy suggested David Stern knew which envelope had the Knicks' logo card so he could delivery the once in a generation talent that was Patrick Ewing.
  
    I personally don't believe the theory so, bored on a slow Friday at work, I looked at all the times since that there was a sure fire prospect in the lottery (excluding Never Nervous Pervis Ellison, because I didn't want to explain to the nephews that he was supposed to be one of the GOATs).  I looked at where the can't miss prospect landed, the probability of them going there, who else was in the lottery with a high chance of winning, and debated why it could have or wouldn't have been a conspiracy for them to land there.  Then I provide my verdict of how crazy it would be to suggest THAT lottery was rigged.  I did this more for me, but I hope it gets you through your post-lunch shit on a Friday.  But I hope the post isn't so long that you get hemorrhoids reading it.
  
1987- David Robinson, San Antonio Spurs. Odds of winning: All teams 14.29%;  Others in the hunt: Phx, NJ, LAC, NY, Sac, Clev; Case For Conspiracy: The league wanted to give small market teams a chance and gave a sure fire center to a city with a military presence that could wait for him to finish his service.; Case Against Conspiracy: You have NY and LA sitting right there. The NBA doesn't care about the San Antonios of the world.  Give them a win another year.
  
Tin Foil Verdict*:* Favors no conspiracy, so you look silly in your tin foil hat.
  
1988 Danny Manning, Los Angeles Clippers; Odds of winning: All teams 14.29%; Others in the hunt:  Indy, Philly, NJ, GS, Phx;   Case For Conspiracy:  The second biggest market and a team that needed some momentum to be an alternative to Lakers dynasty*; Case Against Conspiracy:* Magic had LA wrapped up for the League.  They could have given Barkely some help in Philly, or boosted NJ in the media rich tri-state area.
  
Tin Foil Verdict: Doesn't have strong support for either possibility, so tin foil hat is optional.
  
1992 Shaquille O'Neal, Orlando Magic;   Odds of winning: 15.2% (2nd); Others in the hunt:  Minn, Dal, Denv, Wash; Case For Conspiracy:It is an era of major expansion, so pick one of the teams to get a beast of a prospect.  One of the best since Ewing.  (Note:  at first I thought maybe a Disney/ESPN connection would be fun to play with but, Disney didn't buy ABC/ESPN until 1996); Case Against Conspiracy: Why Orlando instead of Minnesota?  Neither are great markets. Washington was at least a decent size media market in the Nation's capital.
  
Tin Foil Verdict: Totally a toss up because there were no good options.  Just don't wear your tin foil hat after Labor Day.
  
1993 Chris Webber, Orlando Magic; Odds of winning: 1.5% (11th); Others in the hunt:  Dal, Minn, Wash, Sac, Philly; Case For Conspiracy: Big jump from 11th to first for back to back #1s.  Let's pair an elite athlete with Shaq and create an exciting young dynasty. ; Case Against Conspiracy: They already have an MVP in the making in Shaq and almost made the playoffs his first season.  They really didn't need to double down.  Surely it is Minnesota's turn now if you are handing out favors.  A couple of decent teams is better than one stacked team in a small market in Florida.
  
Tin Foil Verdict: There's enough possibility here that the tin foil hat is only slightly silly.
  
1997 Tim Duncan San Antonio Spurs; Odds of winning:  21.6% (2nd);  Others in the hunt:  Bos (two picks in top 6!), Den, Philly; Case For Conspiracy: Robinson was coming back, and they thought they could market a new Twin Towers.; Case Against Conspiracy: It's still San Antonio.  Plus, you have the winningest franchise in the League's history (at least at the time), waiting for Larry Bird to walk through that door).
  
Tin Foil Verdict:  Totally the opposite case of conspiracy.  Conspiracy definitely favors sending Duncan to Boston.  Put away the Reynolds tin foil…
  
2002 Yao Ming Houston Rockets; Odds of winning:  8.9% (5th); Others in the hunt:  Chic, GS, Mem, Den Case For Conspiracy: Houston had a good owner and a diverse city with a large Asian population.; Case Against Conspiracy: GS would have been a better fit as a coastal city with a much larger Asian population.
  
Tin Foil Verdict: No real feel for this either way.  Tin Foil hat optional.
  
2003 LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers; Odds of winning:  22.5% (T-1st); Others in the hunt:  Den, Tor, Mia; Case For Conspiracy: He grew up in Akron.  That kid in the bow tie was adorable (R.I.P.).  It was a great story.; Case Against Conspiracy:  (1) It is fucking Cleveland. (2) The idea of LeBron in Miami is silly, right? (3) That bow tie kid had fucking super powers.
  
Tin Foil Verdict:  Probably still just probability, but this one you see a few other fellows wearing tin foil hats around the water cooler.
  
2007 Greg Oden, Portland Trail Blazers; Odds of winning:  5.3% (7th); Others in the hunt:  Mem, Bos, Mil, Atl; Case For Conspiracy: They jumped 6 spots to get him.  Paul Allen was a powerful figure.  Portland was kind of due after years of suffering.; Case Against Conspiracy: The League doesn't care about Portland.  Boston is sitting there again.  The only way this was a conspiracy is if the League KNEW Oden's knee was going to give out, KD was the next big thing, and they thought it was funny.
  
Tin Foil Verdict:  If you wear a tin foil hat here, fashion a tin foil chastity belt to go with it.
  
2008 Derrick Rose, Chicago Bulls; Odds of winning:  1.7% (9th); Others in the hunt:  Mia, Sea, Minn, Mem; Case For Conspiracy: 8 spots for the home town hero in a big market that needed their Jordan replacement.; Case Against Conspiracy: I got nothing.
  
Tin Foil Verdict:  I know math is sometimes weird, but I might have to fashion my own tin foil hat here.
  
2012 Anthony Davis, New Orleans Hornets; Odds of winning:  13.7% (4th); Others in the hunt:  Char, Wash, Clev;  Case For Conspiracy:Post-Katrina New Orleans needed a hero. ; Case Against Conspiracy: You give them something in a different year versus an instant All Star who belongs in a city like…LA.
  
Tin Foil Verdict:  Wear your tin foil hat if you think the League has a soft heart some years after a major storm.
  
2019 Zion Williamson, New Orleans Pelicans; Odds of winning:  6% (7th); Others in the hunt:  NY, Clev, Phx, Chic, Atl; Case For Conspiracy: Post-AD Post-Katrina New Orleans needed a hero!; Case Against Conspiracy: Chicago?  NY?  They are on the board.
  
Tin Foil Verdict:  At least put a Yankees or Cubs cap on over your tin foil to recognize the odds.
  
2023 Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs; Odds of winning:  14% (T-1st); Others in the hunt:  Hou, Det, Char, Port; Case For Conspiracy: The League loves this franchise. ; Case Against Conspiracy: No one loves San Antonio this much.  Not even Texans as we remember the Alamo.
  
Tin Foil Verdict:  I'm down to just the cardboard roll so I can't even start a tin foil hat here.

       NBA DFS Picks & Analysis for Friday (2/9)
    






    Yesterday was pretty good. I was very close to a takedown but my lineup sputtered at the end. A lot of my picks worked out, starting with Luka (79!), while I was very high on the Knicks and made McBride/Jalen/DSJ core plays.
  
    They all smashed their respective price tags. In my YouTube show (every week day, hit up my reddit profile for the link) I said I was really into closing the slate with KD. He ended up being a little chalky, but he was a smash play.
  
    Also talked up Vince Williams, who went off. Overall, it was a good slate. Hopefully you rolled with some of my favorite plays and cashed as well. If so, please tell me your success stories in the comments.
  
    It's onto a new slate, though. I'll go over it here, but be sure to subscribe to my YT channel for my video that comes later in the day with updated analysis.
  
Top NBA DFS Game Environments for 2/9



    Hawks vs. 76ers
  


    Nuggets vs. Kings
  


    Pelicans vs. Lakers
  


    These are the three best spots for game stacks when you look at point spread, pace, and game total. You can still use players from other games or stack other games, but these are your three best bets.
  
    Two other games are going to look appealing on the favorite's side, but they are likely blowouts with 14+ point spreads. I'll break them all down later in my YouTube show so make sure you're subscribed (link in reddit profile) so you get an updated breakdown.
  
Best NBA DFS Picks for Friday



    PG: Tyrese Maxey ($9.2k)
  


    SG: Jaylen Brown ($8.3k)
  


    SF: Miles Bridges ($8.6k)
  


    PF: Tobias Harris ($7.7k)
  


    C: Nikola Jokic ($11.6k)
  


    Maxey opens the slate as a potential core play for me. He's been bad the past two games, but he has one of the best matchups of the slate and Joel Embiid remains out. I like Philly a lot tonight.
  
    SG typically sucks, but if Jayson Tatum is out (Q) then Brown looks awesome. There is blowout risk here, but the matchup and role would be so good I wouldn't care. Not nearly as interested if Tatum plays, but he'd still be plenty viable.
  
    Miles Bridges might be a garbage person off the court, but he's great for DFS. He is in career mode right now, so why stop now? The Bucks are a good matchup, so blowout risk be damned, he looks fantastic with his price still barely ticking up.
  
    Harris isn't getting any pricier, so we can lean on his rock solid role in a smash spot. I also like a cheap Zion ($7.1k), but we don't know if he's playing yet.
  
    I'll close things out with Jokic. Giannis looks awesome vs the Hornets, but he could end up being the chalky stud on this slate. If Joker is going to be lower owned in a game with a much closer spread, I think he's a good tourney play. Both look like the two best studs to target, though.
  
    Anthony Davis also looks very tempting at $10.2 and Sengun at $9k is also alluring.
  
Friday's Top NBA DFS Values



    PG: Amen Thompson ($5.3k)
  


    SG: Kevin Huerter ($5k)
  


    SF: Jae Crowder ($4.5k)
  


    PF: Onyeka Okongwu ($6.2k)
  


    C: Eugene Omoruyi ($3.8k)
  


    Thompson was a smash play last time and with FVV out again I see zero reason not to go back to the well here. His price has come up, but he's still too cheap for a dude who put up 44 fantasy points in 34 minutes last time out.
  
    Aaron Holiday and maybe even someone like AJ Green are deeper punts that we can consider, but they're not yet core plays for me.
  
    Huerter's price remains steady. He's going to push for 30+ minutes when his shot is falling and he played well the last time he faced Denver. He's not a lock for me, but I have no issue getting to him at the moment. Malik Monk is a fine pivot for $600 more, and I'll also have interest in Cody Martin ($5.2k).
  
    If I'd played Crowder over Keyonte George last night (took an ownership angle) I'd have scored a takedown. It's always that 1 v 1, isn't it? Anyways, he looks good again here, as he is getting major minutes and Dame is Q again.
  
    Onyeka is not a true value based on price, but he might still be too cheap. Clint Capela is still out so he is going to push for 35 minutes. I'd expect him to smash against a Joel Embiid-less 76ers squad.
  
    Eugene is no stud and the matchup with Boston stinks, but the Wiz have no bigs. They could roll out Kuz at the 5 and then we'd be in trouble here, but as long as Omoruyi starts I am fine taking the dive.
  
My NBA DFS Strategy for 2/9

    I won't establish my core for the day this early, but it's easy to see who projects well and suddenly your lineups start to take form.
  
    Amen Thompson and Eugene Omoruyi are probably the value building blocks on this slate, and then you're likely going to want to choose a stud between Giannis and Jokic. My preference based on ownership is going to be Nikola, but I don't know if you can go wrong here.
  
    More news is sure to create chaos on this slate, but hopefully this sets you up for success and nudges you in the right direction. If you're not tuning in for my daily video, be sure to find the link in my reddit profile so you get updated analysis later in the day.
  
    Please upvote (and subscribe to my channel) if I'm helping you, and feel free to discuss your favorite plays and/or how you did last night. Thanks for reading, and good luck!

       Fact of the day. Spencer Dinwiddie has the lowest FG% for the entire NBA this year for players that qualify
    






    Spencer was ranked 141 out of 141 for FG% in the NBA for players that qualify for NBA Player Stats.  https://www.espn.com/nba/stats/player/_/table/offensive/sort/fieldGoalPct/dir/asc


    Also, if you want to get more advanced, his effective fg% was 48% ranking him #414 in the entire NBA, which is third worst in the NBA for players averaging 30+ minutes per game.https://www.nba.com/stats/players/advanced?CF=MIN*GE*30&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&dir=D&sort=EFG_PCT

    edit:  (The only two players with worse effective FG% are Jordan Clarkston and Shaedon Sharpe - both of whom were moved from starter to bench players two months ago by their respective teams)
  

    On top of the bad shooting, Dinwiddie's defense was questionable at best, and his attitude/vibe was pretty poor.  While the Nets still have will have a lot of issues, Dinwiddie moving on should be positive for the team.

       Why Cardano will fail
    






TVL is growing through the bear - I'm not sure why people think this is a good thing. The total value locked in defi is getting close to the previous all-time high for the chain. How are people expected to use the token if all of them are locked away in dapps?
  
Utility-focused NFTs are growing in popularity - I miss the days when buying an NFT meant spending thousands of dollars on a jpg. I want expensive PFPs for my Discord and Twitter. Now all the NFTs are focused on increasing defi rewards, fractionalized ownership of mining rigs, telecom networks, real estate, or data analytic tools. I think I speak for all of us when I say I just want expensive pictures again.
  
Lending/Borrowing protocols are everywhere - Debt isn't a good thing, no matter how much you might want to believe it is. Increasing the ability of the average crypto Joe to get into debt is a dangerous prospect.
  
There are no wallet drainers - Scammers make up a huge facet of the crypto GDP. Without wallet drainers, these hard-working folks are forced to use social engineering and other labor-intensive tactics to scam their victims. When they don't earn fair wages, what money can possibly trickle down?
  
    I like Charlie Hoshkindad but he's got to fix some of the issues with this chain or it isn't going to make it.

       12 reasons Cardano can't scale in 2022
    






    This post is a reality check on IOHK's latest investor disinformation campaign: https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/01/14/how-we-re-scaling-cardano-in-2022/

    Tldr: It's great to see they are starting to acknowledge Cardano's scalability problem, or at least pumping the brakes on their unsubstantiated claims of having solved the trilemma. For the first time, 2021 saw the Cardano community publicly acknowledge some of the limitations of their design that critics have pointed out for years. We've come a long way since IOHK was still pretending this was almost ready to go: https://nitter.net/iohk_charles/status/1287481374224420864

1. BLOCK SIZE/ 2. MEMORY/ 3. STORAGE INCREASES

    The bigger the blocks, the higher the memory, and the more storage- the faster the chain. Basically every chain that isn't already run on super computers can increase blocksizes, memory or storage requirements if they are OK with more centralization and less stability. That's the trade off. That's true for Cardano, and it's true for every other chain.
  
    But how much room does Cardano have to increase parameters? Cardano already has pretty much the same blocksize as Ethereum (72Kb vs ETH's average of 80Kb) and dramatic increases in blocksize will decrease the number of people who can afford to run nodes, and it also makes the network more likely to fork. The theoretical max limit is 28x the current blocksize, but that is almost certainly not practically possible, and no one supports increasing it to even half of that (which is about the most that has ever been tested), because increasing the blocksize isn't free. How critical is it for Cardano to maintain as small of blocksizes as possible?
  
    Critical enough that the plan is to only increase in 12.5% intervals when absolutely necessary. The fact that anyone is at all hesitant to increase Cardano's limit when it's 72kb tells you that this isn't a free trade. There is no plan to ever reach max parameters. Edit: they can actually increase the block size OR decrease the block time, but as they both directly factor into block propagation times, either choice produces the same throughput limit. The decision has more to do with which hardware requirements you want to increase.

    What makes Cardano fundamentally slower than every other chain is how bloated their tx sizes are. We've all heard the sales pitch "And Cardano has native tokens that don't need smart contracts!," but what you didn't get told is that native UTXO txs on Cardano are an average of 500 bytes WITHOUT smart contracts. And that a basic, native tx is larger than the average Ethereum tx WITH smart contracts.
  
    And no, the "And Cardano can combine 20 txs into 1 !" meme doesn't make any difference. The size and speed of each block is all the same regardless of whether you call it 1 tx or 20tx's. The only thing combining txs does is make Cardano significantly cheaper to DDOS.
  
https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/metrics/network-activity

    Native Cardano UTXOs are bigger than the average Ethereum tx, and Plutus smart contracts txs are even bigger that - a lot bigger- like 40x the size of Ethereum smart contracts:
  
Sundaeswap determined that the Cardano network was their primary bottle neck and measured Cardano's real-world throughput for their smart contracts to be 0.15 TPS. That's 47x slower than a native UTXO on Cardano, 100x slower than an Ethereum tx, and 66,000x slower than a Cosmos and Terra tx. 0.15 TPS is a max of 12,960 txs per day, under ideal conditions... on the entire Cardano chain.

    Edit: Sunday swaps medium posts are all offline now. https://web.archive.org/web/20220117005224/https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819

    Cardano's problem is much bigger than anything that can be fixed with a 2x parameter adjustment. Max parameters will never be implemented, and even then, they would still leave Cardano more than 3x slower than the second slowest L1 chain, Ethereum.
  
4. Pipe Lining and 5. Input Endorsers

    ...are great ideas. So why are these still in the research phase? They're promising to deliver a plan that hasn't even been designed yet. Let's assume these get designed and developed in 2022. Then Cardano is in the ballpark of Ethereum L1's low tps and high congestion.
  
6. Plutus Script Enhancements

    These are basic functions (that are still in the research phase because of how they conflict with provability in Hydra). Plutus should not even have been released before they developed reference and data inputs. That was an obvious problem, and it was a huge mistake that will create chaos and disappointment.
  
    Edit: putting something as basic and critical as reference inputs on the roadmap for 9 months after smart contracts are released is the definition of "move fast and break things." Also, nobody has explained how they solved the conflict with provability. They didn't leave it out of Plutus because it's a minor problem: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3dc6zG9EjWE&t=37m30s

    Cardano will alway have much larger txs than non-UTXO chains because native UTXOs are so large. On top of that, Plutus' smart contract implementation is extremely bloated and inefficient. The problem is that Cardano's UTXO model can't store smart contracts on-chain. So instead of calling an on-chain smart contract, every Cardano SC tx must include the SC script in every tx, because there is no on-chain SC that can simply be referenced again and again. This makes every Cardano smart contract very large.
  
    Cardano currently does native asset txs (without smart contracts) at 7 TPS, and that's the theoretical minimum SC size, if they figure out how to compress SCs 47x. And that means that Cardano SCs will always be at least twice as slow as Ethereum L1's unbearably slow 15 TPS, for the same blocksize.
  
    Now is a good time to point out that it's clear from their rhetorical focus of comparing their chain to the next slowest chain, that Cardano holders have no idea how slow Ethereum is. Up to this point in time, almost all of Cardano's txs have been basic UTXO's that haven't filled up blocks, because they are a small fraction of the size of smart contracts.
  
    Four months after going live, no one really uses smart contracts on Cardano yet. Muesliswap doesn't even have $100 Million in TVL (and doesn't have $5M in liquidity to other tokens). Small NFT drops did bring the network to a crawl, but we haven't seen speeds across the whole network change dramatically like they will when Sundaeswap launches a real DEX and much bigger txs flood the chain Thursday.
  
    And catching up to Ethereum L1 will not be good enough. Ethereum has L2s already, and nobody would use Eth L1 if it went live for the first time today. Ethereum has the first mover advantage of having all the liquidity. Whales don't care about a $200 fee, they care about liquidity. They need to move in and out of large positions quickly with as little price impact and slippage as possible.
  
7. Node Enhancements

    This is not a scaling solution. Yes, fix your bugs and optimize your code. No other chain thinks a node update is a "scaling solution." This is ridiculous. Let me say this again: Cardano is currently 66,000x slower than Cosmos and Terra.
  
8. Side-chains

    Great idea. But Cardano doesn't have any decentralized side-chains, and they didn't even get serious about funding any until late last summer. Proper sidechains are the real solution. Milkomeda is on the right track with their M1 sidechain. It's an accounts model Solidity EVM sidechain that has 32 permissioned nodes and uses slashing. Congratulations on abandoning all of your stated goals, and rushing to produce something usable. We waited six years so Catalyst could fund BSC 2.0.

9. Hydra

    A comprehensive plan for interhead Hydra implementation that approaches anything close to a generalized L2 has yet to be described, let alone developed. We're still waiting for a basic description of how isomorphic state channels will ever scale dApps or have any use between untrusted parties. Hydra's 2022 release schedule is for payment channels between trusted parties. Yes, it will be able to handle smart contracts, but not any smart contracts that dApps use. Hydra heads have to be closed every time a party joins or leaves, and they have no known application for dApps. Hydra is really irrelevant, because native UTXO transfers aren't the problem right now.

10. Off-chain computing


    "Transactions occur outside of the blockchain itself, yet can offer fast, cheap transactions via a trust model."
  

    Brilliant. This is a creative solution. Off-chain trusted computations. Finally something that makes sense. Yes, Cardano users should definitely do their computations somewhere they trust, off-chain... Muhammad Fucking Christ. Let me suggest they do their computations on one of the 79 other L1 blockchains.
  
    Edit: there's a massive difference between off-chain to a trusted party and off-chain to decentralized, trustless rollup or side chain. They are not remotely the same. That's why Sundaeswap had to come up with the convoluted scooper model and Maladex wrote a book detailing their experimental solution to countering the specific vulnerabilities of off-chain code (some of which on-chain verification will never detect). In the YouTube link above, Sebastien from DC Spark says Cardano is years away from having rollups.
  
11. Mithril


    To achieve greater scalability, you need to address the complexity of critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of participants.
  

    What? This is straight gibberish. Mithril is obviously not a relevant scaling solution. Mithril is a solution to a problem that many other chains don't even have. Even Ethereum can run a trustless lite client for nodes. Wtf does that have to do with how slow Cardano SCs are? Light client nodes don't write blocks in Cardano. Your inability to figure out a trustless lite client is irrelevant right now.
  
12. Fees

    The short term consequence of Sundaeswap's launch will be a DDOS attack. Txs across the entire Cardano network will take days to process. I predict that Sundaeswap will be forced to throttle their volume, so that the rest of the chain is usable. Best case scenario for EOY 2022, Cardano users can expect Ethereum L1 tx speeds, if everything goes right.
  
    And Cardano has another problem they still haven't solved that Ethereum doesn't have. Slow blockchains require high fees, and Cardano doesn't have dynamic fees. Price fixing always creates shortages. They need dynamic fees. There's no way around supply and demand. Everyone has been saying Cardano's fee model wouldn't work for years. IOHK is just now taking the question seriously, and their recent moves on fees makes it clear that they have no idea what they are doing.
  
    People don't pay fees for fun. The fees are the only thing that make Ethereum usable. You can underpay gas on Ethereum and wait days for the tx to go through if you want, but you can't manage Defi positions or even use a DEX without cutting in line to get immediate settlement.
  
    It doesn't matter that txs have a deterministic order. The Cardano chain can't compute every tx (off-chain) and magically update price feeds with future prices, before the blocks are written. Even on Ethereum txs frequently fall outside of reasonable slippage in minutes. The slippage required to guarantee a tx over 24 hrs would regularly be a double digit percentage of the trade amount. And high slippage is especially a vulnerability for Cardano because so many dApps feature some risk of trusted party ordering. Low slippage is a protection against that.
  
    Also, fees are how slow chains keep from getting Ddos attacked (RIP🏴‍☠️ NANO). If less than 13k txs take 24 hours to clear, anyone can completely stop all traffic on the Cardano network for the cost of 13k txs. And they can render it functionally unusable for a fraction of that. The Cardano community has only recently begun to admit that priority fees will be necessary, and their plans for tiered fees are poorly thought out. Search their sub for "fees" and read them blindly trying to reinvent the wheel. This is basic economics, and they have done no real research on it.
  
    For years we were told that the whole point of Cardano was to avoid launching broken products like this. Cardano's reputation will never recover from this "Move slow and break things" for a food DEX (that originally chose to launch on BSC).
  
    ADA was worth more in 2018 than it was worth during its dip last week. What coin do you think ADA holders will have to sell to buy the other half of liquidity pairs to earn rewards on these DEXs? 🤔
  
    Cardano has not been waiting to release better designed, more secure products. Txs that take days was not part of the 4d chess plan. Look at Sundaeswap's audit and the Plutus exploit. It's the same stuff we see on other chains, plus slow txs, plus trusted off-chain elements, plus a roadmap that is critically reliant on problems that are unsolved.
  
    None of these problems are going away in weeks. The problem with Cardano is the complete lack of honesty from leaders and influencers like Charles Hoskinson, who regularly makes false claims, and a culture of over optimism and anti-critical thinking. Their plan isn't going well, and their jobs rely on them not admitting it.

       Cardano Community is surprisingly mature
    






    Have mostly had sensible conversation with ADA holders and most seem to be grounded to reality, not expecting anything crazy but realistic goals both in price and its use case.
  
    Also very impressed with how stable the community has been during the mega crash.

       It’s been over 11 weeks and there are still no Cardano dapps
    






    Since my first post that was almost 11 weeks ago raising concerns about the “upcoming” dapps on Cardano, there have been no news on this.
  
    I was not only personally insulted in PMs, called a FUDer and an liar by the vast majority of Cardano holders, but was also told that Cardano dapps would be running 1 week after Alonzo Fork and dexes like Sudaeswap and ERGO would be fully functional any “moment” after the Alonzo Fork.
  
    So, are there any news about that?? Did the concurrency problem get resolved? If yes, why are there no functioning dexes on Cardano yet? Can someone from the Cardano community enlighten us please?

    My brother just gave me his old gaming laptop, didn't ask for anything in return.
  
    I have some ADA so I told him to download Yoroi and just sent him 100 ADA. It took seconds to arrive.
  
    No bank. No VISA. No government. No BACS. No Swift. No cash.
  
    Just me, him and the blockchain.
  
    Fucking. Cool.
  
    Edit: This isn't to say (a) this is Cardano's sole capability; or (b) solely Cardano has this capability - this experience just brought to life my theoretical understanding of the whole project (value, identity, governance) and I thought it was neat enough to share. Peace and love to you.

       Lethal Tempo nerf is probably my favourite change for 14.4
    






    Yone top is is probably dead, not knowing what kind of compensation he will get. If Any.
  
    Not being able to cheese prio with his insane lvl1 massively hurts this champ, as well as basically losing every duel in top lane pre 6 without LT. They've nearly halved the Atk speed PER STACK which means longer CDs and longer cast times in early skirmishes.
  
    I don't think people realize just how much Yone and Yasuo rely on this rune being op. It completely carries them early.
  
    The breakpoint is around lvl 8-10 and onward it's a buff.
  
    Is it a good change? Absolutely!
  
    Yasuo and Yone are not supposed to stat check you at lvl1. Well Yasuo will check you at some point of the game either way but Yone is supposed to hyperscale - or something close to a scaler. These type of champs are supposed to have a worse early game. And this Keystone is completely eradicated that weakness for way too long.
  
    Will champions gettng compensation buffs for this? We have to wait and see. He was balanced around ConQ back in the days and it felt balanced. He felt like the scaler he should be.

       Lethal Tempo nerf is probably my favourite change for 14.4
    






    Yone top is is probably dead, not knowing what kind of compensation he will get. If Any.
  
    Not being able to cheese prio with his insane lvl1 massively hurts this champ, as well as basically losing every duel in top lane pre 6 without LT. They've nearly halved the Atk speed PER STACK which means longer CDs and longer cast times in early skirmishes.
  
    I don't think people realize just how much Yone and Yasuo rely on this rune being op. It completely carries them early.
  
    The breakpoint is around lvl 8-10 and onward it's a buff.
  
    Is it a good change? Absolutely!
  
    Yasuo and Yone are not supposed to stat check you at lvl1. Well Yasuo will check you at some point of the game either way but Yone is supposed to hyperscale - or something close to a scaler. These type of champs are supposed to have a worse early game. And this Keystone is completely eradicated that weakness for way too long.
  
    Will champions gettng compensation buffs for this? We have to wait and see. He was balanced around ConQ back in the days and it felt balanced. He felt like the scaler he should be.

       Lethal Tempo nerf is probably my favourite change for 14.4
    






    Yone top is is probably dead, not knowing what kind of compensation he will get. If Any.
  
    Not being able to cheese prio with his insane lvl1 massively hurts this champ, as well as basically losing every duel in top lane pre 6 without LT. They've nearly halved the Atk speed PER STACK which means longer CDs and longer cast times in early skirmishes.
  
    I don't think people realize just how much Yone and Yasuo rely on this rune being op. It completely carries them early.
  
    The breakpoint is around lvl 8-10 and onward it's a buff.
  
    Is it a good change? Absolutely!
  
    Yasuo and Yone are not supposed to stat check you at lvl1. Well Yasuo will check you at some point of the game either way but Yone is supposed to hyperscale - or something close to a scaler. These type of champs are supposed to have a worse early game. And this Keystone is completely eradicated that weakness for way too long.
  
    Will champions gettng compensation buffs for this? We have to wait and see. He was balanced around ConQ back in the days and it felt balanced. He felt like the scaler he should be.

       Lethal Tempo nerf is probably my favourite change for 14.4
    






    Yone top is is probably dead, not knowing what kind of compensation he will get. If Any.
  
    Not being able to cheese prio with his insane lvl1 massively hurts this champ, as well as basically losing every duel in top lane pre 6 without LT. They've nearly halved the Atk speed PER STACK which means longer CDs and longer cast times in early skirmishes.
  
    I don't think people realize just how much Yone and Yasuo rely on this rune being op. It completely carries them early.
  
    The breakpoint is around lvl 8-10 and onward it's a buff.
  
    Is it a good change? Absolutely!
  
    Yasuo and Yone are not supposed to stat check you at lvl1. Well Yasuo will check you at some point of the game either way but Yone is supposed to hyperscale - or something close to a scaler. These type of champs are supposed to have a worse early game. And this Keystone is completely eradicated that weakness for way too long.
  
    Will champions gettng compensation buffs for this? We have to wait and see. He was balanced around ConQ back in the days and it felt balanced. He felt like the scaler he should be.

Posts Must Be Directly Related To League of Legends

















    Posts must focus on and be directly related to League of Legends: the game, the league community (fanart, cosplay, fanfiction, etc), and league esports. For posts related to personalities and esports, the content must focus on players/orgs interactions with the game and not their lives outside of it.

Don't Address Individuals or Distinct Entities

















    This subreddit is here for users to communicate with each other and not just pass a message to an organization or individual without involving a major subset of the community. Posts must be made so that any user can participate in the discussion in a relevant manner. As such, you cannot directly address individuals, entities, or organizations in the entirety of posts made.

    Feature suggestions regarding what should or should not be in the game are allowed, provided they aren't directly addressing Riot or using titles leading to a "Yes, No" answer that can only be replied in an official manner by Riot.

Reposts

















    A post may be considered a repost if it covers the topic from nearly the same angle as existing posts.
  
    Frequently asked questions and topics will be removed. Please use the search function.
  
    Posts will no longer count as a repost at 1 month for posts over 300 upvotes and 1 week for posts between 50 and 300 upvotes.
  
    Please note that when multiple people attempt to post the same content in a short period, we may approve the one with the most traction and remove others.

       Lethal Tempo nerf is probably my favourite change for 14.4
    






    Yone top is is probably dead, not knowing what kind of compensation he will get. If Any.
  
    Not being able to cheese prio with his insane lvl1 massively hurts this champ, as well as basically losing every duel in top lane pre 6 without LT. They've nearly halved the Atk speed PER STACK which means longer CDs and longer cast times in early skirmishes.
  
    I don't think people realize just how much Yone and Yasuo rely on this rune being op. It completely carries them early.
  
    The breakpoint is around lvl 8-10 and onward it's a buff.
  
    Is it a good change? Absolutely!
  
    Yasuo and Yone are not supposed to stat check you at lvl1. Well Yasuo will check you at some point of the game either way but Yone is supposed to hyperscale - or something close to a scaler. These type of champs are supposed to have a worse early game. And this Keystone is completely eradicated that weakness for way too long.
  
    Will champions gettng compensation buffs for this? We have to wait and see. He was balanced around ConQ back in the days and it felt balanced. He felt like the scaler he should be.
